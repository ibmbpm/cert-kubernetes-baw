This Font Software is licensed under the SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1.

This license is copied below, and is also available with a FAQ at: 
http://scripts.sil.org/OFL

SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE

Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007

PREAMBLE

The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide 
development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation 
efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and 
open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership 
with others.

The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and 
redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The fonts, 
including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, redistributed and/or 
sold with any software provided that any reserved names are not used by 
derivative works. The fonts and derivatives, however, cannot be released under 
any other type of license. The requirement for fonts to remain under this 
license does not apply to any document created using the fonts or their 
derivatives.

DEFINITIONS

"Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright Holder(s) 
under this license and clearly marked as such. This may include source files, 
build scripts and documentation.

"Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the copyright 
statement(s).

"Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as 
distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).

"Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting, or 
substituting — in part or in whole — any of the components of the Original 
Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a new environment.

"Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical writer or other 
person who contributed to the Font Software.

PERMISSION & CONDITIONS

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of the 
Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify, redistribute, and sell 
modified and unmodified copies of the Font Software, subject to the following 
conditions:

    1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components, in 
    Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.
    2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled, 
    redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy contains 
    the above copyright notice and this license. These can be included either as 
    stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or in the appropriate 
    machine-readable metadata fields within text or binary files as long as those 
    fields can be easily viewed by the user.
    3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font Name(s) 
    unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding Copyright 
    Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as presented 
    to the users.
    4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font Software 
    shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any Modified Version, except 
    to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) 
    or with their explicit written permission.
    5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole, must be 
    distributed entirely under this license, and must not be distributed under any 
    other license. The requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not 
    apply to any document created using the Font Software.

TERMINATION

This license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are not met.

DISCLAIMER

THE FONT SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR 
IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS 
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF COPYRIGHT, PATENT, TRADEMARK, OR 
OTHER RIGHT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES 
OR OTHER LIABILITY, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR 
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING 
FROM, OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE FONT SOFTWARE OR FROM OTHER DEALINGS IN 
THE FONT SOFTWARE.
